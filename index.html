<h1> The Story in the Book
</h1>
<h2>Chapter 01
</h2>
<p>
Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i> nature, new scientist,</i> and all the color sientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <i> on the Road.</i> It had been Molly's fovourite book since college, and the longer she spentin these four walls the more she felt she need to be free.

<p>
She had spend the last ten years in this room,sitting under a poster with an oscar Wilde quate prolaiming that "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do". Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the Ilama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, molly  <i> did </i> think she had something better to do.
